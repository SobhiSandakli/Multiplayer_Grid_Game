# Warriors Of The Grid
Warriors of the Grid is a multiplayer grid game developed during the LOG2990 course. The project showcases the implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in a dynamic multiplayer environment. The client is built using Angular, providing an interactive and responsive user interface, while the backend is powered by NestJS, enabling real-time communication through WebSockets.
